JetStream-xDB-Extensions
======================

This project contains the code that I used for demonstrating some of the xDB extensibility capabilities for the Cincinnati Sitecore User Group Meeting. The demo was built on the JetStream website and on Sitecore 8.1.

The deck used for this session is [here](https://thesitecorezone.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/extending-sitecore-xdb.pptx), and the session recording is available [here](https://youtu.be/mWa4WrI6qcE).

I will shortly put up a few blog posts explaining this implementation.
